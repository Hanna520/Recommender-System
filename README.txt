A recommendation system, also known as a recommender system, is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. Main techniques for solving recommendation system problems include collaborative filtering, contentbased filtering, knowledge-based systems, and hybrid systems (which uses a combination of the collaborative filtering and content-based filtering).

In this project, we aim to build a movie recommendation mechanism with movie ratings from Netflix users (the data are from Kaggle). This is a typical recommendation system problem, and the appropriate technique for this porblem is collaborative filtering since we only have the ratings information available. The following eight algorithms were experimented: SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), SVD++ (SVD Plus Plus), NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization), BaselineOnly, SlopeOne, KNNBasic, KNNBaseline, and KNNWithMeans.
